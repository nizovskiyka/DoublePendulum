# DoublePendulum
Task 2 of the practicum.
Double pendulum on oscillating base.
*Still in production
On classroom machine the programm causes the bind stack overflow error. The reason for this is local variable nu (it must be either global or the function parameter). In old maxima versions it is inacceptable. However the new maxima works fine.*
If you solve this, pls commit me. I'm just too lazy for this:^)
